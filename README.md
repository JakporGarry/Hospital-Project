## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- BOOTSTRAP
- JQUERY
- FONTAWESOME
- DESKTOP-FIRST EORK FLOW


### What I learned
It's my first project ever made with bootstrap after getting comfortable with css, 
it wasn't as difficult as I first thought it would be thanks to a solid foundation in CSS, the overall experience
has taught me that having a solid foundation in any technology makes life easier moving forward.

I didnt have a design template so I changed and chopped as I continued which was time consuming, 
My plan started with a brain storming to determine the core features,
followed by the list of features and a little scheme. I soon realized my plan lacked of clarity
due to my inexperience, my mental model was too close to the user point of view and i wasn't able to 
see upfront how tricky/challenging some of these parts were! 

Having never worked with JQUERY before now, it was tricky at some point As i had to also learn JQUERY
